This is a sample non-GUI IDE based tic tac toe program. 
The program begins by allowing player 1 to be O.
The first player (X) then chooses the row number (1-3) that they would like to place their mark in.
X then chooses the column number (1-3) that they would like to place their mark in.
If that position is taken or if they do not input a valid row or column number then they must choose again.
The new board will be displayed in the IDE once X finished their turn. 

Player 2 is the O. 
Similar to player 1, O chooses the row number (1-3) that they would like to place their mark in.
O then chooses the column number (1-3) that they would like to place their mark in.
If that position is taken or if they do not input a valid row or column number then they must choose again.
The new board will be displayed in the IDE once X finished their turn.

Once someone gets three in a row the program declare a winner and end. 
If all the positions on the board are taken then the program will declare a tie and end.
