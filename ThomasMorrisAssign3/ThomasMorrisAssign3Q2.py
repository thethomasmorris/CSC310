Instructions:
Implement the program which merges two sorted singly-linked lists 
and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing 
together the nodes of the first two lists. 
You should use your own class and include a testing.
Note:
Pages 256-266 of Data Structures and Alogrithms were referenced
